Some great books and articles for specific topics are listed below.

#### [Shell Scripting by Jason Cannon](https://www.amazon.com/Shell-Scripting-Automate-Command-Programming-ebook/dp/B015FZAXU6)

Short and sweet, this is a good book for absolute shell scripting beginners.

#### [Wicked Cool Shell Scripts - Dave Taylor & Brandon Perry](https://nostarch.com/wcss2)

Ideal for systems administrators and power users who can benefit from automating processes across many platforms. This book contains a lot of tips on how to standardise the behaviour of programs across Linux and Unix systems. If you find yourself regularly shell scripting and want to start to build a library of your own scripts to run across machines, this is a great book to read. It will be particularly useful for anyone who faces challenges on incompatibilities and inconsistencies between programs on different systems.

#### [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought, Drew Niel](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980)

Absolutely the best book I've read on Vim, perfect for users of all levels. Written by Drew Niel, who is the author of the amazing [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) series.

#### [Joshua Levy - The Art of the Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line)

This is a wonderful repository, which aims to help you "Master the command line, in one page". This page is full of useful resources and is a superb reference for users from novice all the way to advanced!
