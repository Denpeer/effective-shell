# Section Zero - For the Complete Newcomer

This section is for those who are completely new to this topic. In this section we'll introduce just what the shell is, who this book is useful for, and what you can expect to learn.

We'll also look at how to set your computer up so that you can follow along with the examples. We'll finish by demonstrating a few basic skills so that you can learn to move around in the shell and get started with the rest of the book.

If you are already comfortable with running a shell, know what _Bash_ is, and know how to run basic commands like `ls` and `cd`, then you can completely skip this section.

If you are already comfortable with running a shell, know what `bash` is, and know how to run basic commands like `ls` and `cd`, are familiar with terms like _command_ and _parameter_ then you can skip this section. You could also just review the [Summary]({{< relref "/docs/section0/6-summary" >}}) to make sure that you are comfortable with the material which has been introduced and then move onto the next section.
