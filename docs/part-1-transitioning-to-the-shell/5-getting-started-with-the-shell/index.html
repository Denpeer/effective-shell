<strong>Getting Started with the Shell</strong></header><article class=markdown><h1 id=getting-started-with-the-shell>Getting Started with the Shell</h1><p>If you have never used the shell before, then this is where we'll start. We're not going to go into lots of detail, there's plenty of that later on in book. Instead we'll do a quick crash course on the basics. If you have not used the shell before this'll give you a chance to see how it works.</p><p>Start by opening your shell. This is covered in <a href=../3-opening-the-shell/_index.md>Opening the Shell</a>. Your shell should be <em>Bash</em> - if this doesn't sound familiar, then make sure you have followed the instructions in <a href=../4-configuring-the-shell/_index.md>Configuring the Shell</a>.</p><p>You should see your terminal program running your shell. You can see what the <em>version</em> is of your shell by running:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>bash --version
</code></pre></div><p><img src=./images/bash-version.png alt="Screenshot: Bash Version"></p><p>Let's quickly dissect this. We have run the <code>bash</code> <em>command</em>. A command can be a program on your computer, or it can be something built into the shell. We'll look at this in a lot more detail later, but for now it's important to understand that a lot of what you will be doing is running commands.</p><p>The <code>--version</code> text is a <em>parameter</em>. Parameters affect how commands work. This is actually easier to see with an example.</p><p>Let's move to the <em>home</em> folder. On most computers your home folder is your personal space where things like documents, photos, music, downloads and so on are kept.</p><p>Let's switch to the home folder by running the following command:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>cd ~
</code></pre></div><p>Once you've done that, run the <code>pwd</code> command:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>pwd
</code></pre></div><p><img src=./images/moving-to-home.png alt="Screenshot: Moving to the home directory"></p><p>So what has happened here? The first command:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>cd ~
</code></pre></div><p>Is used to <em>change directory</em> - that's what <code>cd</code> stands for. The <em>parameter</em> we passed to <code>cd</code> was just the &lsquo;tilde&rsquo; character (<code>~</code>). This character has a special meaning in the shell - it means &ldquo;the current user's home directory&rdquo;.</p><p>Finally, we ran the <code>pwd</code> command. This command is short for <em>print working directory</em>. It writes out to the screen <em>where</em> you currently are. On my Mac, my home directory is located at <code>/Users/dwmkerr</code>, which is what the command has shown me.</p><p>Let's take another look at a command. Run the following in your shell:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>ls
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>ls</code> command is short for <em>list directory contents</em> - it shows you everything that is in the current directory. On my computer you can see things like the &lsquo;Downloads&rsquo;, &lsquo;Music&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pictures&rsquo; folders, which are set up by default on a Mac, as well as some of my own folders.</p><p><img src=./images/ls.png alt="Screenshot: List directory contents"></p><p>We can pass different parameters to <code>ls</code>. The main parameter is the location of the folder we'd like to list the contents of. So if we wanted to see what was in the <code>Music</code> folder, we'd just run:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>ls Music
</code></pre></div><p>Not much to see here:</p><p><img src=./images/ls-music.png alt="Screenshot: List the contents of the Music directory"></p><p>Many commands actually allow us to pass multiple parameters. For example, we could list the contents of my Movies and my personal applications:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>ls Movies Applications
</code></pre></div><p><img src=./images/ls-movies-apps.png alt="Screenshot: List the contents of the Movies and Applications directory"></p><p>There's not much in either. You might wonder why <em>Applications</em> is so empty - that's because we're looking at the applications <em>only installed for the current user</em>, because we are in the user's home directory. To see the applications for <em>everyone</em> we'd need to use the folder where applications are kept for <em>all</em> users.</p><p>We can do this by running <code>ls /Appliciations</code>:</p><p><img src=./images/ls-applications.png alt="Screenshot: List global applications"></p><p>The trick here is that we start with a leading forward slash - this means the <code>Applications</code> folder in the <em>root</em> of the computer, not the one in my current folder.</p><p>On Windows, applications are kept in different places, but we can see some of the installed applications by running <code>ls "c:\program files\"</code>:</p><p><img src=./images/ls-applications-windows.png alt="Screenshot: List applications on Windows"></p><p>Why do we have the extra quotation marks here? If we ran the command without the quotation marks, the shell would think we were giving it <em>two</em> parameters. It would think we wanted to see the contents of the <code>c:\program</code> and <code>files</code> folders - and they don't exist!</p><p><img src=./images/ls-applications-windows-error.png alt="Screenshot: List applications on Windows incorrectly"></p><p>The error above shows what happens when we miss the quotation marks.</p><p>Now we can take a look at how a <em>flag</em> would work. A flag is a parameter which changes how a command works. Flags normally start with a hyphen. Let's say we wanted to know the <em>size</em> of the files in the folder. We do this by using the <code>-lh</code> pass the parameter, which is short for <em>long list, human readable</em>:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>ls -lh Downloads/*.jpg
</code></pre></div><p><img src=./images/ls-downloads.png alt="Screenshot: List downloaded photos"></p><p>Now I can see all of the <code>jpg</code> files (<code>jpg</code> files are images) in my <code>Downloads</code> folder. I can see it looks like I've got two pictures of &ldquo;Mardi Himal&rdquo; (a mountain in the Himalayas) which are both 384 Kilobytes in size, as well as some other images. Blow by blow, this is what we've got:</p><ul><li><code>ls</code> - List the contents of a folder</li><li><code>-lh</code> - This is the <em>long list in human-readable sizes</em> parameter, which means we see how big the files are in a friendly format (like <code>911K</code> for Kilobytes, rather than showing something like <code>911012</code> which would be the number of bytes - and harder to read!)</li><li><code>Downloads/*.jpg</code> - Show the contents of the <code>Downloads</code> folder, including any files which end with <code>.jpg</code> - the <code>*</code> is a wildcard which means that we don't mind what the filename is</li></ul><p>The <code>-lh</code> parameter is <em>shorthand</em>. Many commands offer longhand parameters (such as <code>--version</code>) as well as shorthand (such as <code>-v</code> as an alternative for <code>--version</code>). Longhand is easier to read, shorthand is faster to type.</p><p>Don't worry - in the next section we'll see how to look up the available parameters for a command. You don't need to remember all of these details, only understand which part is the command and which parts are the parameters. This is just an introduction for now!</p><p>Now let's look at one more command.</p><h2 id=the-echo-command>The Echo Command</h2><p>The &lsquo;echo&rsquo; command is used to write out a message in the shell. Here's an example of how it works:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>echo <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Hello Shell!&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This command writes out the text <code>Hello Shell!</code>:</p><p><img src=./images/echo-hello-shell.png alt="Screenshot: Echo command"></p><p>Why would we do this? One of the most common reasons would be to <em>see</em> what the shell thinks a certain value is. For example, try this command:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>echo <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;</span><span style=color:#e6db74>My home directory is at: </span>$HOME<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You'll see something like this:</p><p><img src=./images/echo-home.png alt="Screenshot: Echo the home directory"></p><p>The <code>$HOME</code> part of the text is called a <em>variable</em>. We can recognise variables because they start with a dollar symbol. <code>$HOME</code> is a built-in variable which holds the location of the current user's home directory.</p><p>We're going to see all sorts of cool things we can do with <code>echo</code> as we continue in the book!</p><h2 id=move-around>Move Around</h2><p>One common thing we can do in a visual file explorer is move around. We can open folders, and go &lsquo;up&rsquo; from the current folder. We often also see visually where we are in the folder structure with an &lsquo;address bar&rsquo;.</p><p>A useful reference might be the picture below:</p><p><img src=./images/shell-commands.png alt="Screenshot: Shell quick reference"></p><p>Here we map the shell commands to the visual interface's equivalents:</p><ul><li><code>pwd</code> shows the current working directory - where you currently are in the file system</li><li><code>ls</code> lists the files in the current directory (or any directory you tell it)</li><li><code>cd ..</code> changes the directory to another location - if you use the special <code>..</code> directory, you are telling it to change to the <em>parent</em> directory, i.e. &lsquo;go up&rsquo; in the file system</li></ul><p>As a final trick, lets see how we open a file or folder. Let's say I want to open one of the photos in my Downloads folder. Here's how I can do it:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>cd ~/Downloads
open himalayas.jpg
</code></pre></div><p>We can see the result here:</p><p><img src=./images/open-command.png alt="Screenshot: Open a photo"></p><p>Running <code>open himalayas.jpg</code> has opened the photo in the application which is used for photos by default in the operating system.</p><p>Be aware - this command is different on different operating systems (but we're going to see later on how to fix that and make it consistent everywhere!). The <code>open</code> command will open a file on MacOS. On Windows you can use <code>start</code>, and on Linux you can generally use <code>xdg-open</code>.</p><p>As a nifty trick, trying running <code>open .</code><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>:</p><p><img src=./images/open-current-directory.png alt="Screenshot: Open the current directory"></p><p>. This will open the <em>current folder</em>. Every folder contains two &lsquo;special&rsquo; folders. The first is <code>..</code>, which we've seen means &lsquo;my parent folder&rsquo; and the second is <code>.</code>, which means &lsquo;myself&rsquo;. Having this <code>.</code> folder is convenient, as it means we can do things like this - run a command to open the current folder.</p><p>We're going to go into a lot more detail on how to work with files and folders, move around, but hopefully this has provided a crash course for the basics. They key <em>concepts</em> to remember, which are much more important than the individual commands we've see are:</p><ul><li>In the shell we run <em>commands</em></li><li>We can change how commands work by using <em>parameters</em></li><li>Some parameters just go at the end of the command - like <code>ls Downloads</code></li><li>Some parameters start with a hyphen, and change how the command behaves - these are often called &lsquo;flags&rsquo;. An example is <code>ls -lh</code>, which lists the files in the current folder with a human-readable file size</li></ul><p>We've also learned:</p><ul><li><code>cd</code> changes the current directory</li><li><code>pwd</code> prints the current directory</li><li><code>ls</code> lists the files in a directory</li><li><code>echo</code> can be used to write out text to the screen</li><li><code>open</code>, <code>start</code> and <code>xdg-open</code> can be used to open a file or folder on MacOS, Windows and Linux respectively</li></ul><p>Now we can start to get into more detail!</p><hr><h2 id=footnotes>Footnotes</h2><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>On Windows you might need to run <code>start .</code> and on Linux, <code>xdg-open .</code>. <a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></article><div class="book-footer justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/dwmkerr/effective-shell/commit/4979eefda71764abb9ea603bdcf7da3f3927a88c title="Last modified by Dave Kerr | Apr 3, 2020" target=_blank><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
