Some great books and articles for specific topics are listed below.

The Linux Command Line - William Shotts
Wicked Cool Shell Scripts - Dave Taylor & Brandon Perryi
How Linux Works - Brian Ward

## Beginners

[Shell Scripting by Jason Cannon](TODO) - For absolute beginners this book might be useful. However, it is _very_ short and really only covers a few topics. I suggest that for a beginners book, something with a bit more content may be better.

Great books!

Shell Scripting: How to Automate Command Line Tasks Using Bash Scripting and Shell Programming - Jason Cannon
How Linux Works, 2nd Edition: What Every Superuser Should Know - Brian Ward
Wicked Cool Shell Scripts, 2nd Edition: 101 Scripts for Linux, OS X, and UNIX Systems - Dave Taylor
The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction - William E. Shotts Jr.

## Shell Programming Books

This is list of useful books which are about Shell Programming, Terminal usage, Vim usage etc.

- [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought, Drew Niel](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980): Absolutely the best book I've read on Vim, perfect for users of all levels. Written by Drew Niel, who is the author of the amazing [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) series.
- [Modern Vim: Craft Your Development Environment with Vim 8 and Neovim, Drew Niel](https://pragprog.com/book/modvim/modern-vim) - I've not read it yet but will do so ASAP.

## Advanced
