If you are not an IT professional, that doesn't matter! This book is written for anyone, from beginners to experts. Experts might skip past some of the earlier sections, beginners might find it more useful to go through each section in order.

The goal of this book is to be a collection of small, contained tutorials on how to use the shell more effectively, you can go through it sequentially or just pick and choose the sections which seem the most interesting.

Use the 'Comments' section on each page to let me know if you have questions, and for experts, don't be shy about [opening a pull request](https://github.com/dwmkerr/effective-shell/pulls) to propose changes.
