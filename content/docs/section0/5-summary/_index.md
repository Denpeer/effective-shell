# Summary

In this section we learnt:

- That this book is for IT professionals, hobbyists or anyone who wants to learn more about how to work with computers
- How to open the shell programs for Windows, Mac and Linux which are installed by default
- How to configure the shells for Windows or Mac to behave in a Linux-like way to allow us to follow on with the rest of the book

With these tasks complete we can now move onto the next section.
