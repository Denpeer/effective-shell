## Proofing Notes

When proofreading, consider:

1. `which` vs `that` - a common error
2. `â€”` vs `-`

## Improvements

- [ ] Add `tree` to the Chapter 'Moving Around'.

## Ideas

- [ ] Background/Foreground Processes
- [ ] `screen` and `tmux`
- [ ] ANSI C Escaping (see https://www.dwmkerr.com/quick-tip-sending-newlines-with-curl/#comment-4375113010)
